    <h1>About PlayersB</h1>
    <p><a href="/">← Back to home</a></p>

    <h2>What PlayersB is</h2>
    <p>
      PlayersB is a player-first utility platform focused on comparison tools, performance normalization,
      and fantasy-safe decision support. The site is built around <strong>player entities</strong> and
      repeat-use tools rather than news or predictions.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Player A vs Player B comparison tools</li>
      <li>Performance calculators (per-90, per-minute, efficiency)</li>
      <li>Fantasy-oriented tools that explain scoring and tradeoffs</li>
      <li>Clear, documented methodology for every metric</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What PlayersB is not</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No sportsbook or betting platform</li>
      <li>No betting tips, locks, or guaranteed picks</li>
      <li>No news aggregation or live-score service</li>
      <li>No opaque or unexplained “AI predictions”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our approach</h2>
    <p>
      We prioritize explainability and structure. When we use derived metrics
      (such as consistency or efficiency), inputs and assumptions are documented.
      Tools are designed to help users understand tradeoffs, not to tell them what to do.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsible use</h2>
    <p>
      Sports outcomes are uncertain. PlayersB tools are educational and informational.
      If you participate in wagering where legal, do so responsibly and within local laws.
