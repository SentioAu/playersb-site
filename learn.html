    <p>
      PlayersB is tool-first. This section explains the <strong>minimum methodology</strong> behind our comparisons so you can
      trust what you see and understand the tradeoffs.
    </p>

    <h2>Core principles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Normalize before comparing:</strong> totals can mislead when minutes differ, so we use per-90 / per-minute metrics where appropriate.</li>
      <li><strong>Explainable outputs:</strong> if we compute a score (e.g., consistency), we show what goes into it.</li>
      <li><strong>No predictions:</strong> PlayersB does not publish “locks” or guaranteed outcomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key concepts (short, practical)</h2>

    <h3>Per-90 (why it exists)</h3>
    <p>
      Per-90 answers: “If this player played a full match, what would their rate look like?”
      It helps compare players with different minutes played.
    </p>

    <h3>Efficiency vs volume</h3>
    <p>
      Some players produce by volume (many shots/touches), others by efficiency (higher conversion).
      Comparisons should show both—otherwise you misread the role.
    </p>

    <h3>Consistency (simple definition)</h3>
    <p>
      Consistency isn’t “best player.” It’s “how stable is the output over games?”
      A basic version can use variability of recent outputs relative to the average.
      Lower variability → more consistent.
    </p>
